# FavourAsKeyword (FL0083)

*Introduced in `0.23.9`*

## Cause

When an unnecessary pattern is used in a match expression.

## Rationale

Enhance readability and brevity, simplify the code, and make it more idiomatic to F#.

## How To Fix

Replace the pattern with a constant, followed by ‘as’, and then the variable name.

## Rule Settings

    {
        "favourAsKeyword": {
            "enabled": true
        }
    }
